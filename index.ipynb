    "In this lab we will be using our skills from flask, dash, pandas, and sqlalchemy to create a dashboard that contains graphs that we can manipulate to show data based on our input. We will be working with a very large dataset containing information on rent and population demographics in the US. We will be using the ETL pattern to create extract, format (or transform), and enter (or load) our data into our database. Let's get started!"

    "* Instruct to set up database -- import Sqlalchemy and create models -- create_all in terminal\n",
    "* Instruct to use pandas to read the excel file & fillna with 0.0\n",
    "* Walk through ETL Pattern -- uses the data, database, and models to bring information over to our program and easier to use/query\n",
    "* Once database is setup and populated, instruct to create a layout that uses a callback to populate a div's children with a bar graph that has each city's population for a given state\n",

Our package should have an `__init__.py` file that imports dash and instantiates a new app with a `url_base_pathname` of `'/dashboard'`. Next, we will need to create our run file in our top-level directory which starts the server for us with debug mode assigned to True.\n",
